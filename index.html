<pre>  
    Falling too fast to prepare for this
    Tripping in the world could be dangerous
    Everybody circling is vulturous
    Negative, nepotist
    Everybody waiting for the fall of man
    Everybody praying for the end of times
    Everybody hoping they could be the one

    I was born to run, I was born for this
    Whip, whip
    Run me like a racehorse
    Hold me like a ripcord
    Break me down and build me up

    I wanna be the slip, slip
    Word upon your lip, lip
    Letter that you rip, rip
    Break me down and build me up
    Whatever it takes
    'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

    I do whatever it takes
    'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
    Whatever it takes
    Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
    Whatever it takes
    'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

    I do what it takes
    Always had a fear of being typical
    Looking at my body, feeling miserable
    Always hanging on to the visual
    I wanna be invisible
    Looking at my years like a martyrdom
    Everybody needs to be a part of 'em

    Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
    I was born to run, I was born for this
    Whip, whip
    Run me like a racehorse
    Hold me like a ripcord
    Break me down and build me up
    I wanna be the slip, slip
    Word upon your lip, lip
    Letter that you rip, rip

    Break me down and build me up
    Whatever it takes
    'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
    I do whatever it takes
    'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
    Whatever it takes
    Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
    Whatever it takes
    'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
    I do what it takes

    Hypocritical, egotistical
    Don't wanna be the parenthetical
    Hypothetical, working onto something that I'm proud of
    Out of the box, an epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
    I'm an apostrophe, I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
    I'm just a product of the system of catastrophe
    And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half diseased
    And when I am deceased
    At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
    Leave the body of my soul to be a part of thee
    I do what it takes
    
    Whatever it takes
    'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
    I do whatever it takes
    'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
    Whatever it takes
    Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
    Whatever it takes
    'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
    I do what it takes</pre>
